# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I started by creating all the most basic classes: member,affair,organization. Then I created all their plural classes: members,affairs,organizations. Then nothing worked and I spend 2 days trying and failing to keep good seperation. I gave in and added all classes below the base manager class. I know this is very ugly, but I would rather be chased by wild dogs than fight with typescript anymore, so thats the way it is.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> More googling than I could possibly specify. The general sites being stack overflow, W3, Typescript documentation, and Mozilla JS documentation.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 15 i think, it all kind of blurred togeather.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 3 if you've ever used typescript before, 9 if you're like me and have never touched typescript, javascript, or webdev in general.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> While refering to typescript arrays as lists in the assignment is more acurate than as true arrays, for someone like me who has never used javascript arrays, i spent quite a while trying to find the basic utility list like java or c# provides. Calling them arrays in the assignment would have saved me a good bit of time.
